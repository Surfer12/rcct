# frameworks libraries architecture
The RCCT (Recursive Chain-of-Thought) implementation uses:
1. Spring Boot 2.7.0 with WebFlux for reactive programming
2. Thymeleaf for HTML templating
3. Reactor Core for reactive programming patterns
4. Jackson for YAML parsing and serialization
5. JUnit Jupiter for testing

The application follows a layered architecture:
- Model: ThoughtNode, CCTModel
- Service: ThoughtProcessingService
- Controller: VisualizationController
- View: HTML templates with JavaScript for interactive visualization

# react visualization project-structure
The React implementation of the RCCT visualizer has the following components:

1. App (root component) - Manages application state and composition
2. ThoughtTree - Displays hierarchical thought structure
3. VisualizationPanel - Renders visualizations using D3.js
4. DetailsPanel - Shows detailed information about selected nodes

Key technologies:
- React with TypeScript for UI components
- D3.js for interactive visualizations
- React-Syntax-Highlighter for code display

Project structure:
- src/
  - components/ (React components)
  - data/ (Sample data for the visualization)
  - types/ (TypeScript type definitions)
  - App.tsx (Main application component)
  - App.css (Styling)
  - index.tsx (Entry point)

# docker deployment configuration
Docker deployment for RCCT application includes:

1. Spring Boot Backend Dockerfile:
   - Multi-stage build with Gradle build stage and JRE runtime stage
   - Uses JDK 21 for compilation and JRE 21 for runtime
   - Exposes port 8080 for the API
   - Includes Spring Boot Actuator for health checks

2. React Frontend Dockerfile:
   - Multi-stage build with Node build stage and Nginx runtime stage
   - Uses Node 18 for building the React application
   - Uses Nginx as a production web server
   - Custom Nginx configuration for SPA routing and API proxying
   - Exposes port 80 for web access

3. Docker Compose configuration:
   - Coordinates both services in a single deployment
   - Sets up a bridge network between frontend and backend
   - Configures environment variables for Docker-specific settings
   - Includes health checks for the backend service

4. CORS and proxy configuration to allow secure communication between services

The system is designed for easy deployment with a single "docker-compose up" command.

# implementation annotation configuration visualization
The RCCT implementation includes these technical components:

1. Data Models:
   - @Entity annotations for JPA persistence
   - @Data, @NoArgsConstructor, @AllArgsConstructor Lombok annotations for reduced boilerplate
   - Entity relationships using @OneToMany annotation with cascading
   - ID generation with @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)

2. Service Layer:
   - @Service and @Transactional annotations for business logic
   - Methods for creating, processing, and evaluating thoughts
   - Recursive processing implementation for thought nodes

3. Controller Layer:
   - @Controller with @RequestMapping for routing
   - @GetMapping and @PostMapping for RESTful endpoints
   - @ResponseBody for JSON responses
   - Thymeleaf integration for HTML templates

4. Visualization:
   - Interactive web interface with SVG visualization
   - Dynamic tree structure representation
   - JavaScript for client-side interactions
   - CSS for dark-mode UI design

5. Configuration:
   - Spring Boot application properties for different environments
   - H2 in-memory database configuration
   - Docker-specific configurations
   - Actuator endpoints for health monitoring
