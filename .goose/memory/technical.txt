# frameworks libraries architecture
The RCCT (Recursive Chain-of-Thought) implementation uses:
1. Spring Boot 2.7.0 with WebFlux for reactive programming
2. Thymeleaf for HTML templating
3. Reactor Core for reactive programming patterns
4. Jackson for YAML parsing and serialization
5. JUnit Jupiter for testing

The application follows a layered architecture:
- Model: ThoughtNode, CCTModel
- Service: ThoughtProcessingService
- Controller: VisualizationController
- View: HTML templates with JavaScript for interactive visualization

# react visualization project-structure
The React implementation of the RCCT visualizer has the following components:

1. App (root component) - Manages application state and composition
2. ThoughtTree - Displays hierarchical thought structure
3. VisualizationPanel - Renders visualizations using D3.js
4. DetailsPanel - Shows detailed information about selected nodes

Key technologies:
- React with TypeScript for UI components
- D3.js for interactive visualizations
- React-Syntax-Highlighter for code display

Project structure:
- src/
  - components/ (React components)
  - data/ (Sample data for the visualization)
  - types/ (TypeScript type definitions)
  - App.tsx (Main application component)
  - App.css (Styling)
  - index.tsx (Entry point)
