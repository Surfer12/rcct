# frameworks libraries architecture
The RCCT (Recursive Chain-of-Thought) implementation uses:
1. Spring Boot 2.7.0 with WebFlux for reactive programming
2. Thymeleaf for HTML templating
3. Reactor Core for reactive programming patterns
4. Jackson for YAML parsing and serialization
5. JUnit Jupiter for testing

The application follows a layered architecture:
- Model: ThoughtNode, CCTModel
- Service: ThoughtProcessingService
- Controller: VisualizationController
- View: HTML templates with JavaScript for interactive visualization
