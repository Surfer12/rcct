# project-structure java spring-boot visualization
The RCCT (Recursive Chain-of-Thought) project is a Java/Spring Boot application that implements a recursive thought processing model. Key components include:

1. ThoughtNode - Core data structure representing a thought with sub-thoughts, supporting hierarchy and aliasing
2. CCTModel - Model for evaluating thought nodes recursively with memoization
3. ThoughtProcessingService - Service layer for processing thoughts
4. VisualizationController - Web controller for the interactive visualization interface

The project uses a visualization-heavy approach with interactive diagrams and explorers. The interactive-integration-explorer.html provides a web interface for exploring the CCT model.

# concepts integration meta-cognition memoization
The project implements several key concepts:

1. Recursive Self-Reference: Ability of thought structures to reference themselves (ThoughtNode.aliasNode)
2. Memoization/Caching: Optimization through storing computed results (CCTModel.memoizationCache)
3. Meta-Observational Framework: System's ability to reason about its own reasoning processes

The structured_analysis documents describe a tripartite integration between:
- Computational implementation (Java/Mojo structures)
- Cognitive modeling (neural processes)
- Knowledge representation (YAML structures)

Key integration points identified in the documentation relate to how these domains can converge.

# file-structure build java gradle

- Main application code in app/src/main/java/
  - com.rcct package: Core implementation
  - com.rcct.model: Data models (ThoughtNode, CCTModel)
  - com.rcct.service: Services (ThoughtProcessingService)
  - com.rcct.web: Web controllers (VisualizationController)
- Visualization resources in app/src/main/resources/templates/
- Documentation and analysis in rcct/ directory

# visualization svg web-interface
Key visualization files:
1. interactive-integration-explorer.html - Main web interface for exploring the CCT model
2. cross-domain-integration-visualization.svg - Visualization of domain integration concepts
3. recursive-cct-model.svg - Visualization of the recursive model structure
4. yaml-anchors-aliases.svg - Visualization of YAML representation concepts

The visualizations are central to the project, illustrating complex concepts like recursive thought structures, cross-domain integration, and meta-cognitive processes.

# project-structure architecture technologies docker
The RCCT (Recursive Chain-of-Thought) project implements a Java/Spring Boot application for recursive thought processing with the following key components:

1. Entity Models:
   - ThoughtNode: Represents individual thoughts with properties including content, type, depth, parentId, and metadata
   - CCTModel: Contains collections of ThoughtNodes and manages the overall thought model

2. Architecture:
   - Spring Boot 3.2.3 backend with WebFlux reactive programming
   - Jakarta Persistence (JPA) for data storage and retrieval 
   - Thymeleaf templating for server-side rendering
   - H2 in-memory database for development
   
3. Key Technologies:
   - Java 17
   - Spring Boot with Spring Data JPA
   - Lombok for reducing boilerplate code
   - Thymeleaf for HTML templates
   - Docker for containerization
   
4. Project Structure:
   - Main application in com.anthropic.rcct package
   - Entity models in com.anthropic.rcct.model
   - Services in com.anthropic.rcct.service
   - Controllers in com.anthropic.rcct.controller
   - HTML templates in src/main/resources/templates
   
5. Docker Integration:
   - Multi-stage build process
   - Docker Compose for orchestration
   - Container health checks
   - Environment-specific configuration

# concepts goals vision design
The RCCT project has these core conceptual goals:

1. Recursive Thought Processing:
   - Implement a computational model of recursive thought chains
   - Support meta-cognitive reflection (thoughts about thoughts)
   - Enable deep hierarchical thought structures
   - Provide memoization for efficient processing

2. Cross-Domain Integration:
   - Bridge computational implementation with cognitive modeling
   - Connect formal data structures with knowledge representation
   - Support interoperability between different reasoning systems
   - Enable translation between different thought representation formats

3. Interactive Visualization:
   - Provide intuitive visual exploration of thought structures
   - Support real-time manipulation of thought hierarchies
   - Offer multiple visualization perspectives (overview, recursive, cross-domain)
   - Facilitate understanding of complex thought relationships

4. Knowledge Representation:
   - Formalize thought structures in multiple formats (Java objects, YAML, code)
   - Support aliasing and self-reference in thought structures
   - Enable metadata tagging for enhanced processing
   - Provide clean API for thought manipulation
