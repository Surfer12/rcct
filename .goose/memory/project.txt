# project-structure java spring-boot visualization
The RCCT (Recursive Chain-of-Thought) project is a Java/Spring Boot application that implements a recursive thought processing model. Key components include:

1. ThoughtNode - Core data structure representing a thought with sub-thoughts, supporting hierarchy and aliasing
2. CCTModel - Model for evaluating thought nodes recursively with memoization
3. ThoughtProcessingService - Service layer for processing thoughts
4. VisualizationController - Web controller for the interactive visualization interface

The project uses a visualization-heavy approach with interactive diagrams and explorers. The interactive-integration-explorer.html provides a web interface for exploring the CCT model.

# concepts integration meta-cognition memoization
The project implements several key concepts:

1. Recursive Self-Reference: Ability of thought structures to reference themselves (ThoughtNode.aliasNode)
2. Memoization/Caching: Optimization through storing computed results (CCTModel.memoizationCache)
3. Meta-Observational Framework: System's ability to reason about its own reasoning processes

The structured_analysis documents describe a tripartite integration between:
- Computational implementation (Java/Mojo structures)
- Cognitive modeling (neural processes)
- Knowledge representation (YAML structures)

Key integration points identified in the documentation relate to how these domains can converge.

# file-structure build java gradle
Project file structure:
- root directory: /Users/ryanoates/Desktop/rcct/
- Main application code in app/src/main/java/
  - com.rcct package: Core implementation
  - com.rcct.model: Data models (ThoughtNode, CCTModel)
  - com.rcct.service: Services (ThoughtProcessingService)
  - com.rcct.web: Web controllers (VisualizationController)
- Visualization resources in app/src/main/resources/templates/
- Documentation and analysis in rcct/ directory
- Secondary implementation in rcct-secondary/

The project uses Gradle for build management with Spring Boot 2.7.0.
Java version: 21

# visualization svg web-interface
Key visualization files:
1. interactive-integration-explorer.html - Main web interface for exploring the CCT model
2. cross-domain-integration-visualization.svg - Visualization of domain integration concepts
3. recursive-cct-model.svg - Visualization of the recursive model structure
4. yaml-anchors-aliases.svg - Visualization of YAML representation concepts

The visualizations are central to the project, illustrating complex concepts like recursive thought structures, cross-domain integration, and meta-cognitive processes.
