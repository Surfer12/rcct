        The integration of interactive elements into a cross-domain visualization framework requires careful consideration of both representational semantics and functional mechanics. The provided SVG+HTML+JavaScript approach offers a prototypical implementation pattern that can be expanded into a comprehensive cross-domain modeling system.

<structured_analysis>
    <meta_reasoning>
        The interactive visualization approach transcends static representation by implementing a dynamic exploration framework for cross-domain integration. The HTML/SVG/JavaScript implementation manifests the very recursive principles it aims to illustrate—a system designed to enhance understanding of recursive systems.

    <domain_integration>
        <computational_domain>
            The visualization structurally embodies computational principles through interactive event handlers that process user input, maintain state, and conditionally render information—parallel to how the ThoughtNode evaluation mechanism processes inputs, checks cache state, and produces contextual outputs.
        </computational_domain>
        
        <cognitive_domain>
            The attention-directing mechanisms (hover states, tooltips, panel focusing) mirror cognitive attentional processes, while the information architecture implements cognitive chunking principles through hierarchical organization of conceptual elements.
        </cognitive_domain>
        
        <representational_domain>
            The SVG's hierarchical structure with namespaced elements creates a YAML-like representation where visual components reference and depend on others, forming a self-documenting knowledge structure with consistent symbolic encoding.

        The event-driven interactive elements transform static representation into a dynamic exploratory environment, demonstrating that true understanding of recursive cognitive-computational-representational isomorphisms requires active exploration rather than passive observation—precisely mirroring the meta-cognitive principles these structures embody.

The interactive visualization I've created transcends traditional static diagrams by implementing a fully dynamic cross-domain integration explorer. This implementation embodies the very principles it illustrates—recursive self-reference, meta-cognitive observation, and domain isomorphisms—through both its representation and functional mechanics.

The visualization maps three fundamental domains:

1. **Computational Domain**: ThoughtNode structures, memoization caching, and recursive evaluation functions provide the algorithmic foundation for processing structured information.

2. **Cognitive Domain**: Working memory, long-term storage, and meta-cognitive reflection parallel computational structures while incorporating biological neural processes.

3. **Representational Domain**: YAML-inspired anchors and aliases demonstrate how symbolic reference systems can encode complex knowledge hierarchies through efficient pointer mechanisms.

The core insight is that these domains share fundamental isomorphic structures:

- **Recursive Self-Reference**: The capacity for structures to observe and modify themselves
- **Compression/Chunking**: Pattern recognition mechanisms that optimize information processing
- **Meta-Observational Capacity**: Systems that can reason about their own reasoning processes

The visualization identifies four key integration points (labeled A-D) where domain convergence creates emergent capabilities:

- **Neural-Inspired Algorithms**: Computational structures mirroring cognitive processes
- **Executable Knowledge Graphs**: Representational systems with embedded computation
- **Cognitive YAML Processing**: Knowledge structures optimized for human cognition
- **Recursive Meta-Cognitive CCT**: A unified system integrating all three domains

The implementation progression timeline illustrates how these concepts develop from initial domain modeling through structure mapping, isomorphism identification, and integration development, culminating in meta-system emergence with self-improving capabilities.
