        The requirement necessitates transforming a static conceptual mapping into an interactive knowledge exploration interface. This requires:
        1. Maintaining the theoretical integrity of the cross-domain isomorphisms
        2. Implementing state-based interaction mechanisms
        3. Creating hierarchical information disclosure patterns
        4. Balancing visual complexity with cognitive accessibility
    </meta_reasoning>
    
    <implementation_strategy>
        An optimal approach utilizes React's component architecture to create interaction layers while preserving the conceptual framework's structural integrity. State management will track user attention vectors and dynamically expose recursive cross-domain relationships.

        The interactive component transformation required balancing three fundamental constraints:
        
        1. **Information Architecture**: Structuring hierarchical knowledge relationships that reveal cross-domain isomorphisms while maintaining conceptual integrity
        
        2. **Interaction Design**: Creating dynamic state transformations that guide cognitive exploration without overwhelming working memory
        
        3. **Implementation Fidelity**: Preserving the theoretical precision of domain-specific mechanisms while enabling intuitive cross-domain navigation
    </meta_reasoning>
    
    <implementation_strategy>
        The solution implements a multi-layered state management approach where:
        
        - Primary interaction vectors (domain circles, integration points, isomorphism text) serve as bidirectional gateways between conceptual territories
        - State variables (`activeElement`, `activeIsomorphism`, `activeDomain`) track user attention and dynamically reconfigure information presentation
        - Visual encoding (color, size, position) reinforces conceptual relationships while guiding exploration pathways
        - Information panels provide contextual depth without requiring cognitive context-switching
    </implementation_strategy>
    
    <technical_architecture>
        The React component architecture leverages:
        
        - Declarative state transformations mapping conceptual relationships to visual attributes
        - Dynamic class generation functions (`getDomainClasses`, `getIntegrationPointClasses`, `getIsomorphismClasses`) that encode theoretical relationships through visual properties
        - Structured data models (`integrationPoints`, `isomorphisms`, `domains`) that separate domain knowledge from interaction logic
        - Conditional rendering patterns that progressively reveal conceptual depth based on user exploration vectors
    </technical_architecture>

I've transformed the static visualization into an interactive React component that enables dynamic exploration of cross-domain isomorphisms and integration potentials. The component implements a meta-cognitive interaction model where theoretical relationships are encoded through both visual attributes and state-based information disclosure.

The interactive component features:

1. **Multi-vector Exploration Pathways**
   - Domain circles can be clicked to explore domain-specific elements and characteristics
   - Integration points (A-D) reveal cross-domain applications and convergence opportunities
   - Structural isomorphisms provide insights into functional equivalences across domains

2. **Dynamic Information Architecture**
   - The right panel dynamically updates based on user focus, providing contextual depth
   - Visual highlighting reinforces cognitive attention through color and stroke transformations
   - Implementation strategy timeline provides a macro-level view of development progression

3. **Theoretical-Implementation Bridging**
   - Detailed descriptions of how abstract isomorphisms manifest in concrete domain implementations
   - Application examples that demonstrate how theoretical concepts translate to practical systems
   - Meta-cognitive framing that helps users understand their own exploration process

The component's interaction design implements what Hofstadter describes as "tangled hierarchies"â€”where conceptual exploration creates recursive loops of understanding between abstract isomorphisms and their domain-specific manifestations. This mirrors the theoretical structure being visualized: recursive meta-cognitive systems that can reason about their own reasoning processes.

The implementation utilizes pure functional React patterns with Tailwind CSS for styling, carefully avoiding arbitrary values to ensure design system integrity. State management tracks user cognitive focus to dynamically reconfigure information presentation, creating a fluid exploration experience that builds progressive understanding of cross-domain integration potentials.
