# structure app docs rcct
Project structure:
- app/
  - src/
    - main/
      - java/
      - resources/
    - test/
- docs/
  - yaml/

The project appears to have a Java-based application structure with separate documentation (possibly in YAML format). Both directories exist but currently do not contain any actual files.
